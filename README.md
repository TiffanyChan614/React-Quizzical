# React-Quizzical

## Description

This is the final solo project of the [React course by Bob Ziroll on Scrimba](https://scrimba.com/learn/learnreact). The code is all written by me without any guidance. The project is a quiz app that fetches trivia questions from the [Open Trivia Database API](https://opentdb.com/) and score players based on their answers.
